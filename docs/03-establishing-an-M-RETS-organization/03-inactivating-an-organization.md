## Inactivating an Organization

A User with the appropriate permissions may begin the Organization Inactivation procedure by notifying M-RETS in writing from the email associated with a User that has the proper permission level.  The User shall furnish the data that M-RETS should place the Organization into Inactive status. Any Generator assigned to the Organization will become Inactive and may not produce any further Certificates. Moreover, once Inactive Users from the Organization may not access any remaining Certificates or pending Transactions.
