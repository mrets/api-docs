## Users

Users may create additional Users within their Organization by accessing the Organization information tab within the System.

M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

More information about confidentiality can be found in the [M-RETS Terms of Use.](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use)
