### Active Accounts

An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s). An Active Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates. The Active Account is like a cash checking Account. M-RETS Certificates in Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization—depending on the type—may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates.

If the Account has a Generating Unit(s) associated with it, the Active Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates created that are associated with the Generating Unit(s) ID number.
