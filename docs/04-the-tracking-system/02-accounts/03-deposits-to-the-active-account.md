### Deposits to the Active Account

There are four ways that M-RETS Certificates are deposited in an Active Account.

1. The Organization can transfer M-RETS Certificates into their Active Account from another of the Organization&#39;s Active Accounts.
2. The Organization can accept a transfer of Certificates from another M-RETS Organization.
3. The Certificates can be deposited into the Account by M-RETS based on verified generation data from a Generating Unit associated with the Active Account or through an adjustment approved by M-RETS in accordance with the Operating Procedures.
4. The Certificates can be deposited by M-RETS through the import process. If the Organization has more than one Active Account, the Organization can specify in each case the Active Account in which they want the Certificates deposited.
