### Transfers from the Active Account

There are four ways to withdraw or remove M-RETS Certificates from an Active Account:

1. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to another of one&#39;s own Accounts (e.g. retirement), or
2. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to multiple of one&#39;s own Accounts, or
3. Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to the Active Account of another M-RETS Organization, or
4. Export the M-RETS Certificates out of M-RETS to another compatible tracking system.
