### Registration of a Generator

All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription and then register the Generating Unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this Unit is not registered in any other Registry. Generating Unit(s) that are jointly owned must privately appoint a single Organization where the Generator will reside.

To register the Generating Unit(s), the owner of the Generating Unit or the Responsible Party must submit to M-RETS the following:

1. A completed on-line Generator registration form containing information related to the characteristics of the Generating Unit and associated meter.
2. If applicable: A completed [Schedule A from the M-RETS Terms of Use outlining the Generator Owner&#39;s Designation of Responsible Party](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MRETS-Schedule-A-Modified-12-28-2017.pdf).
3. Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration information
  1. It is helpful for Generators to include a Generator interconnection agreement that helps support the registration information. _See_ Acceptable Documentation in Appendix A: Generator Static Data Fields.
  2. Providing a Generators EIA Entity ID which is an official, unique identification numbers assigned by EIA can expedite the approval process. The EIA Entity ID is required for all Generators over 1 MW in the United States and may be found by accessing the report [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860M/).
4. If this Generator will use MISO as the reporting entity, please fill out and upload [this form](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M-RETS-MISO-DATA-RELEASE-2-9-2018213.pdf) in the Generator documents. It is important that the form reflects the correct MISO node.

The Generator registration process will include both mandatory and optional data entry and M-RETS shall verify all data prior to making a Generator Active.

_NOTE: Registration with M-RETS does not imply or confer acceptance into or eligibility for any state&#39;s Renewable Portfolio Standard program._
