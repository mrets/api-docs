### Distributed Generation Aggregation

For small (\&lt;1 MW) Generating Units, M-RETS will allow aggregation (&quot;Distributed Generation Aggregation&quot;) of Units not metered together and which do not share the same location, but which are located within the same state or province, and which otherwise share the same essential generation characteristics identified in Appendix B: Fuel Type &amp; Fuel Source.

Aggregated Generators must meet the following criteria:

1. The M-RETS State/Province programs allows for aggregation if an eligibility is sought; and
2. The Aggregated Units do not exceed a total nameplate capacity of 1 MW.

M-RETS may require documentation to verify each Aggregated Unit and generation data including proof of the right to registration and proof that each unit is within acceptable proximity to the other units.
