### Annual Review of Generators

M-RETS requires Users to update/review Generators once a year during the month of January to ensure correct information. M-RETS will email Users with the requisite permissions as well as prompt them within the System to complete the review.

It is the User&#39;s requirement to confirm that they represent and warrant to M-RETS that all information for their Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief.

M-RETS requires that Organizations review and accept all Generator data by January 31

**Failure to complete the annual review for each Generator in an Organization by January 31 each year will result in the loss of access to the Organization until a User with proper permissions reviews and confirms all of the data for every Generator in the Organization.**
