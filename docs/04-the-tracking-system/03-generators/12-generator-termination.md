### Generator Termination

If M-RETS has cause to permanently terminate the Generating Unit&#39;s participation in M-RETS, M-RETS will cease any further production of Certificates, and the Generator will be inaccessible. Termination of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.
