### Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated

If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party (&quot;Transferor&quot;) wants to change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they can do so by requesting the change from M-RETS in writing or via email.

The Transferor must confirm the following:

1. The Organization Name and Organization I.D. of the Transferor.
2. The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.
3. The effective date of the change and the last vintage that should be issued to the Transferor.

The Transferee must confirm the following:

1. The Organization Name and Organization I.D.
2. The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.
3. The Account Name and Account I.D. to which the Generator will initially issue Certificates upon competition of the change.
4. The effective date of the change and the first vintage that should be issued to the Transferee.
5. Any changes to the static Generator data (e.g. new Reporting Entity, Eligibilities).

Certificates from generation that occurred up to the day the Organization change takes effect will be issued into the Organization that the Generating Unit was associated with at the time the generation occurred.

_For example, if the Generator owner changes the Organization to which a given Generating Unit is associated with from Organization A to Organization B, and the change is effective on March 1, then the Certificates from generation that occurred prior to March 1, will be deposited into Organization A (even though the date of Certificate deposit will be after March 1, because of the lag time between generation occurrence and Certificate issuance.)_

There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generator is not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as an Inactivation/Reactivation of the Generator instead of a change of Organization.

Any fractional remainder MWhs (i.e. any kWh) will transfer to the new owner of the Generator.
